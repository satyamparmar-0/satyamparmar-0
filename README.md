# Hi there, I'm Satyam 👋

I’m a software developer who enjoys turning ideas into reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.  
I focus on writing clean code, clear abstractions, and shipping features that matter.

---

## 🧭 What I’m About
- Pragmatic problem-solver: start simple, optimize with purpose.
- Strong believer in readable code, meaningful reviews, and incremental improvement.
- Enjoy backend architecture, API design, data modeling, and applied AI/ML.
- Learning continuously; teaching when I can.

## 🛠️ Tech Toolbox

| Domain            | Technologies |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Languages         | Python, Java, JavaScript |
| Backend Frameworks| Node.js, Express.js, Django |
| Databases         | SQL (relational), MongoDB (NoSQL) |
| AI / ML           | Model training, experimentation, integration |
| Other Focus Areas | REST APIs, data pipelines, system design |

> I pick tools based on the problem—not the trend.

## 📌 Selected Project Themes
Rather than listing everything, here are categories I’ve worked on (see pinned repos below):
- API-driven backend services
- Full-stack web applications
- AI/ML powered features (classification, automation, data insights)
- Data storage & query optimization (SQL + MongoDB)
- Utility scripts and developer productivity tools

You can explore the repositories on my profile for real implementations.

## 🧪 How I Work
```text
1. Clarify the problem
2. Define data flows & boundaries
3. Build minimal version
4. Add tests & refine structure
5. Iterate with metrics + feedback
```

## 🧠 Current Focus
- Improving depth in scalable backend patterns
- Applying AI/ML models to practical product features
- Writing cleaner internal tooling

---

## 📂 Code Quality Practices
- Consistent formatting (Black / Prettier)
- Type hints (Python) & JSDoc / TS migrations where useful
- Layered architecture for clarity
- Meaningful commit messages
- Test where logic has risk or complexity
- Robust API design (pagination, filtering, versioning, auth, validations)

## ✅ Quick Facts
- I refactor with intent—no churn for churn’s sake.
- I like blending data workflows with application logic.
- I’m comfortable reading code I didn’t write (and making it better).

---

## 🧾 Philosophy
> Good code is a conversation between today’s intent and tomorrow’s understanding.
